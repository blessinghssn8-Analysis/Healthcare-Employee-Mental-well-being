# Workforce Wellness & Productivity Analytics (Healthcare Sector)

## Project Overview
This project delivers a comprehensive workforce wellness and productivity analysis for a healthcare organization, focusing on the measurable impact of employee well-being on operational performance. In high-pressure healthcare environments, employee stress, burnout, and mental health challenges directly affect productivity, absenteeism, and retention.  

The analysis transforms employee wellness data into executive-level insights that support proactive workforce planning, risk mitigation, and evidence-based HR decision-making.

## Business Problem Statement
Healthcare organizations face persistent challenges related to workforce sustainability, including:
- Rising employee stress and burnout
- Increasing mental-health-related absenteeism
- Declining job satisfaction
- Department-level disparities in workload and support
- Elevated turnover intentions among high-risk employee groups

Without structured analytics, these risks often remain reactive rather than preventative, leading to productivity loss, staffing instability, and increased operational costs. This project addresses the need for a data-driven framework to identify early warning signals and guide targeted interventions.

## Dataset Description
The dataset captures employee-level and departmental indicators related to workforce wellness and productivity, including:

- **Employee Stress Level**: Quantifies operational pressure experienced by employees.
- **Job Satisfaction**: Measures baseline employee sentiment and engagement.
- **Mental-Health-Related Absences**: Tracks absenteeism linked to psychological strain.
- **Burnout Frequency**: Indicates chronic fatigue and emotional exhaustion patterns.
- **Workplace Factors**:
  - Workload intensity  
  - Management support  
  - Work-life balance  
  - Recognition and feedback  
  - Role clarity  
- **Departmental Attributes**: Enables cross-functional comparison of risk exposure.
- **Turnover Intention**: Flags potential retention threats before actual attrition occurs.

Together, these variables provide a holistic view of how workplace conditions influence employee outcomes.

## Analytical Approach
The analysis was conducted using Microsoft Excel with a structured, end-to-end workflow:
1. Data cleaning to address inconsistencies, missing values, and formatting issues.
2. Transformation of raw variables into standardized analytical metrics.
3. Creation of calculated fields to derive stress indices, burnout indicators, and absence rates.
4. Aggregation of employee-level data into department-level performance views.
5. Development of an interactive, executive-friendly dashboard to surface key trends and relationships.

The approach prioritizes interpretability, reproducibility, and business relevance.

## Tools & Techniques
- **Microsoft Excel**
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Pivot Tables for multi-dimensional analysis
- Calculated fields and advanced Excel functions
- Descriptive analytics and trend analysis
- Dashboard design and visualization best practices
- KPI-driven reporting for executive audiences

## Key Insights & Findings
- **Stress–Burnout Relationship**: Employee stress shows a strong, near-exponential relationship with burnout frequency, indicating compounding risk under sustained pressure.
- **Burnout and Absenteeism**: Higher burnout levels translate directly into increased mental-health-related absences, impacting workforce availability.
- **Job Satisfaction Decline**: Job satisfaction consistently decreases as stress levels and adverse workplace factors increase.
- **Workplace Drivers of Dissatisfaction**:
  - Excessive workload
  - Limited management support
  - Poor work-life balance
  - Insufficient recognition
  - Unclear role expectations
- **Departmental Disparities**: Certain departments exhibit disproportionately high stress, burnout, and absence rates, signaling localized operational risk.
- **Retention Risk Signals**: Employees experiencing sustained stress and low satisfaction show significantly higher turnover intentions.

## Business & HR Implications
- **Early Risk Detection**: Mental-health absence patterns can be used as early indicators of burnout escalation.
- **Targeted Interventions**: Department-level insights enable focused workload redistribution, leadership support, and policy adjustments.
- **Retention Strategy Alignment**: Addressing workplace drivers of dissatisfaction reduces turnover intention before attrition occurs.
- **Productivity Protection**: Proactively managing stress and burnout safeguards workforce capacity and care delivery continuity.
- **Data-Driven HR Leadership**: Embeds analytics into workforce planning and wellness strategy design.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how workforce wellness data can be converted into strategic intelligence for healthcare organizations. By linking stress, burnout, absenteeism, and turnover intentions, the analysis provides actionable insights that support proactive HR leadership, productivity optimization, and sustainable workforce management.  

The work reflects a practical, real-world analytics approach designed to deliver measurable business value through informed, data-driven decisions.
